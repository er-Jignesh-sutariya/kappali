	<h3>How Kappali works? -</h3>
	<p>&#8594;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>'Kappali' is an app to sell scrap which gives the customer a fair market rate. The smartphone app 'kappali' provides a nature saving structure by reaching authorized recycler through a system to shorting scrap through a pickup system.</b></p><br>

	<h4>( The scrap you donate can cause tree plantation, which can keep the air pure by reaching the right recycler. )</h4><br>
	<p>&#8594;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>MARKET RATE</b> : Kappali is working to deliver the scrap to the authorized recycler, so that the least toxic elements in nature are mixed and the scrap gets a fair price to the customer.</p><br>
	
	<p>&#8594;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>GREEN DONATION</b> : Tree planting can be promoted through GREEN DONATION instead of the value of the scrap we collect, for which the value of your scrap will be credited to 'Kappali Point' and tree planting programme, awareness and education under the guidance of “GUJARAT NI AMIRAT” will be spread.</p><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Based on this, Kappali aims to plant thousands of trees in many areas around the city.</li>
		<li>‘Kappali’ is trying to Rejuvenate Nature by planting thousands of trees instead of scrap.</li>
		<li>Awareness and Education on Domestic waste (Household waste) is provided by 'Kappali' along with its proper disposal.</li>
		<li>Reducing garbage land can prevent air-water-soil pollution.</li>
		<li>Changing everyday life can create a revolution for greenery and fresh air. </li>
		<li>AQI (AIR QUALITY INDEX) which is found in the metropolis, so with development the air of the city can be kept clean. </li>
		<li>The load of the dumping station can be reduced by explaining the type of household waste (Domestic waste). </li>
		<li>Along with this (A.) Connecting the coming generation with the idea of recycling. (B.) Explain the proper use and damage of plastic. (C.) Gaining control over waste flowing into the sea etc. </li>
	</ul><br>
	<p>&#8594;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Just as we have a responsibility to our family, this earth is also our 'mother', so the main purpose of 'Kappali' is to promote tree planting and contribute to keeping the earth green instead of collecting as much debris as we collect.</b></p>
