	<p>&#8594;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waste is becoming a major problem in India, while its recycling process is also very complex in India, there is a lack of proper machinery here. Which poses a huge challenge for <i>BIO-ECODIVERSITY</i>. The biggest problem for which is seen as plastic waste or scrap. While only plastics are becoming a problem for the natural cycle, <b>‘Kapali’</b> is trying to educate on its use, purchase and recycling.</p><br>
	
	<p>&#8594;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waste and scrap are two different things. The process of its proper disposal saves nature, while the loss of its education creates air and water pollution. Waste dumps in many major cities in India generate toxic gases, and polluted water. Which flows into a river or lake and reaches the dinner plate. When proper waste is not disposed of, it also increases the dumping station or garbage land.</p><br>
	
	<p>&#8594;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Module of WASTE FUNDAMENTAL shows the process of <i>REDUCE – RE-USE - RECYCLE</i>. In which disturbance poses a Hazard (risk) of more than 65% on Global Warming.</p><br>
	
	<p>&#8594;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which means we are harming nature if the waste / scrap we produce cannot reach the proper recycle unit.</p><br>
	
	<p>&#8594;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urbanization: Development has led to the destruction of vegetation, resulting in polluted air, metros and large city environments. The biggest example is the <b>‘Pirana dumping station’</b> in Ahmedabad.</p><br>
	
	<p>&#8594;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as water is polluted, so air is polluted for us day by day. If we do not maintain our land properly, so in the coming year, air purifiers like water will have to be compulsorily installed in every home.</p><br>
	
	<p>&#8594;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Germany has ultra-modern RECYCLE machinery, only 18% of the total plastic waste recovered can be authorized plastic. While India lacks RECYCLE machinery for plastic waste, due to which the plastic here is of very lower class in terms of health. It can be recycle but it generates many times more carbon in the air.
